% TODO some way to reduce vspace between rows a bit? couldn't tell from
% figureSeries docs...
% w/ default vspace, 0.25\textheight seems about most I can do to fit 3 rows
% (0.3 was too much)

% More than ~0.49 times \textwidth seems to breakup the rows.
% Goal is to get 2 figures included per row, to have control and kiwi
% experiments (within each fly) side-by-side.
