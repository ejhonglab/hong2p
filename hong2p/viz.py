            `levels_from_labels` for details). vertical lines will be drawn between
            changes in the output of this function.

        hline_level_fn: as `vline_level_fn`, but for horizontal lines.

            [0, 1] and pretty close to 0. increase if constrained layout warning emitted

            see `Figure.colorbar` docs for more details:
            https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.colorbar

        match_axes_size: if True, colorbar will be made same size (for now, just height)
            as Axes. assumed that all Axes are same height and in one row (if multiple).

        axes_index: if `match_axes_size=True`, use `fig.axes[axes_index]` to match

        location: {'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top'}. where new colorbar axes is placed
            relative to axes it's created from. if `match_axes_size=True`, passed as 1st
            arg to `AxesDivider.append_axes`, otherwise passed as `location` kwarg to
            `fig.colorbar`.

        size: passed to `AxesDivider.append_axes` (default: '7%'), if
            `match_axes_size=True`. unused otherwise. '<x>%' means the size of the
            created colorbar axes will be x% of matched `Axes` size (width, if appending

            created colorbar (vs matched) `Axes`.

        cax: passed to `fig.colorbar`. use for more control of size/shape of colorbar,

        ncols: how many columns for grid showing the background of each plane
            (one panel per plane)

        figsize: passed to `plt.subplots`. if passed, none of `width`, `height`,
            `extra_figsize` should be, and `inches_per_pixel` will be ignored.
            (width, height)

        width: figure width in inches. only pass either this or `height`. if you want to
            specify both, use `figsize` instead. this is to specify one and have the
            other calculated (from `nrows`, `ncols`, and `extra_figsize`).
            will ignore and recalulate `inches_per_pixel` to fit figure in this width.

        height: figure height in inches. see `width` documentation.

        extra_figsize: if calculating `figsize`, this can be used to add space for other
            elements besides the images (colorbars, titles, etc). (width, height)

        inches_per_pixel: used to calculate `figsize`, if `figsize` not passed

        imagegrid_rect: passed to `ImageGrid`, to determine size / position it will

            colorbar(s) and any labels/titles should (i think) extent past this.

            (left, bottom, width, height) tuple, where (0, 0) is bottom left, and
            everything should be in [0, 1]. width and height are fractions of figure
            sizes.

        scale_per_plane: if False, min/max of colorscale will be picked from min/max of
            all data (after excluding `minmax_clip_frac`, if it's greater than 0).

        minmax_clip_frac: clip this fraction of data from BOTH the lower/upper end, when
            deciding the limits of the colormap for the background images.
            `v[min|max]` must not be set if this is, and vice versa.
